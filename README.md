Version Control: Git 2.25.1

Instructions for Running the Implementation:
1. Ensure Python is Installed:
   Confirm that Python 3.8 is installed on your machine. You can check the version by running:
   
   python3 version

   
2. Download/Clone the Project:

    Run the script using the following command:

    python3 <script_name>.py

4. Input Data:
   The script will prompt you to enter the input data.
- First, youâ€™ll need to enter the number of cases.
  For each case:
- Enter the number of states.
- Enter the alphabet separated by spaces.
- Enter the final states as space-separated integers.
- Enter the transition table, where each row corresponds to the transitions for a state


5. Output:
The script will output the equivalent pairs of states for each DFA after minimization.
Dependencies:

6. No external dependencies are required for this implementation beyond a standard Python installation.
